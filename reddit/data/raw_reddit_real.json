Think back to the 2022 NBA All-Star Game: Three precocious young point guards \u2014 the Atlanta Hawks\u2019 Trae Young, the Memphis Grizzlies\u2019 Ja Morant and the Charlotte Hornets\u2019 LaMelo Ball \u2014 made the squad and played on the same team in Cleveland.\n\n>In each case, the future for both player and team seemed bright, but fast forward to 2025, and that\u2019s not the case. Young\u2019s Hawks made the Eastern Conference finals in 2021, Ball\u2019s Hornets won 43 games in 2022 and Morant\u2019s Grizzlies were the second seed in the Western Conference in consecutive seasons. Unbelievably, none of the three have won a playoff series since 2022. This doesn\u2019t look like the year the streak will end, with the Hawks and Grizzlies in Play-In territory and Ball\u2019s Hornets again headed for the draft lottery.\n\n>Similarly, all three have seen their career trajectories go sideways, even if it\u2019s happened more in slow motion than in one rapid swoon. Injuries have plagued all three, but unserious defense and stalled development trajectories are also to blame. Ball has been the topic of trade rumors and even a rumored trade demand; Young is a potential free agent this summer whose team has made no serious move toward extending his contract; Morant\u2019s unreliability was a key factor in Memphis\u2019 offseason reset, and he\u2019s already been suspended by his own team this season.\n\n>There might be other individual players who have been more disappointing this season, but as a class, the Southern point guard trio has moved into a league of its own. As a result, those three top my All-Disappointment Team for 2025-26.\n\n>My squad is a list of players who have done the most to fall short of our hopes and expectations, however misplaced they might have been. While I focused more on significant players on big contracts, I sprinkled in a few middle-class guys and developmental cases as well.\n\n>We\u2019re barely one-third of the way into an 82-game season. Things can and do change, and inevitably, some players will play themselves off this list. But as 2026 begins, here are the envelopes. (Stats as of Wednesday afternoon.)\n\n**NBA All-Disappointment Team:**\n\n- Ja Morant\n- LaMelo Ball\n- Trae Young\n- Darius Garland\n- Paolo Banchero\n- Draymond Green\n- Jared McCain\n- Herb Jones\n- Cam Johnson\n- Guerschon Yabusele\n- Indiana\u2019s Youth\n\n\nSource: https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6930954/2026/01/01/nba-season-2025-2026-disappointments/",

    "text": "[Amick] The Mavericks initiated contact with the Golden State Warriors about Anthony Davis. Dallas has interest in Jonathan Kuminga, though the Warriors would have to include more to match contracts, such as the contract of Draymond Green, which they are staunchly opposed to.. [Source](https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6931252/2025/12/31/nba-trade-rumors-lakers-warriors-clippers-hawks-bucks/?source=user_shared_article)\n\n>In the absence of a season-saving deal for Giannis that is clearly unlikely (see above), the Warriors might have to accept the fact that this current group \u2014 by and large \u2014 is going to be it. Here\u2019s why: Team sources say they\u2019re staunchly against the notion of trading either Draymond Green or Jimmy Butler, which creates quite a predicament when you\u2019re trying to match salaries of high-level players.\n\n>While a league source said the Mavericks do have interest in the Warriors\u2019 Jonathan Kuminga, who can\u2019t be traded until Jan. 15 but is widely expected to be dealt before the deadline, the fifth-year forward\u2019s salary ($22.5 million) comes well short of Davis\u2019 ($54.1 million) and would thus require the inclusion of another big contract \u2014 i.e. Green ($25.8 million). Yet as Warriors coach Steve Kerr said publicly last week, and team sources confirmed, a move like that is simply not in their plans.\n\n>\u201dMy No. 1 goal, honestly, is for (Green) to finish his career as a Warrior with us fighting, metaphorically, not literally fighting and competing together until we\u2019re both gone,\u201d Kerr said after his bench dust-up with Green in a game against Orlando on Dec. 22.\n\n>A Butler-for-Davis swap works financially, as the Warriors forward also makes $54.1 million this season, but Golden State has shown no interest in making such a move. While team sources say the Warriors have not completely closed the door on the prospect of doing a Davis deal, it appears unlikely. What\u2019s more, it should be noted that the Mavericks called Golden State about the Davis possibility \u2014 and not the other way around.",

    "text": "[Afseth] Sources told DallasHoopsJournal.com that among the players the Mavericks have interest in from teams that have discussed Davis internally are Jonathan Kuminga of the Golden State Warriors and Zaccharie Risacher of the Atlanta Hawks. The Dallas Mavericks are prioritizing the acquisition of at least one impactful young talent in an\u00a0Anthony Davis\u00a0trade and have interest in Golden State Warriors forward\u00a0Jonathan Kuminga\u00a0and Atlanta Hawks wing\u00a0Zaccharie Risacher, NBA sources told\u00a0Grant Afseth of\u00a0DallasHoopsJournal.\n\nThe Warriors and Hawks are interested in trading for Davis.\n\nGolden State acquiring Davis is considered unlikely, though, since the franchise doesn\u2019t want to part ways with\u00a0Draymond Green\u00a0or\u00a0Jimmy Butler.\n\n\u201cSources previously told\u00a0DallasHoopsJournal.com\u00a0that the Mavericks are prioritizing the acquisition of at least one impactful young talent if they ultimately move Davis. \u2026 Sources told\u00a0DallasHoopsJournal.com\u00a0that among the players the Mavericks have interest in from teams that have discussed Davis internally are Jonathan Kuminga of the Golden State Warriors and Zaccharie Risacher of the Atlanta Hawks,\u201d Afseth wrote.\n\nDavis is eligible for a four-year, $275 million maximum extension in August. The 2020 NBA champion is making $54.1 million this season. He\u2019ll make $58.5 million next season and has a player option worth $62.8 million for the 2027-28 season.\n\nSources told Afseth that Davis will seek a contract extension from the Mavericks in the offseason if he doesn\u2019t get traded this season. If Dallas does trade Davis, the Chicago native and his agent \u2014 Rich Paul of Klutch Sports Group \u2014 will pursue an extension with the team he gets traded to.\n\n\u201cLeague sources have downplayed the likelihood of Golden State moving either Butler or Green, and there is no known traction on multi-team constructions that would send Kuminga to Dallas while redirecting Davis elsewhere; such frameworks are potentially structurally viable should broader talks develop closer to the deadline, though they would require increased market motivation for Davis,\u201d Afseth wrote.\n\n\u201cAtlanta has also remained linked to Davis, but skepticism persists regarding the Hawks\u2019 willingness to assemble a return the Mavericks would consider sufficient. Sources told\u00a0DallasHoopsJournal.com\u00a0that Risacher is viewed as a key piece Dallas would want from Atlanta, though the Hawks have yet to show enough motivation to include him in a trade. League sources believe Atlanta has the cleanest structural ability to construct a trade package in a two-team deal, but its willingness to do so has been described as contingent on the right price.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nSource: https://dallashoopsjournal.com/p/mavericks-anthony-davis-warriors-jonathan-kuminga-hawks-zaccharie-risacher-nba-trade-rumors-news/",

    "text": "The Suns aren't who we thought they were. The Suns were the laughingstock of the NBA (*\\*checks watch\\**) about three minutes ago.\n\nBereft of their own first-round picks until the early 2030s and limping through the wreckage of the Kevin Durant/Bradley Beal era, there wasn\u2019t a lot of hope in the desert. The Suns entered the season with every basketblogger\u2019s least-favorite 20-point scorer (Jalen Green), every casual\u2019s least-favorite superstar (Devin Booker), a revamped front office and coaching staff filled with guys whom owner Mat Ishbia shotgunned a beer with at Michigan State, and a roster composed entirely of undersized wings, former Charlotte Hornets centers, and rookies.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t sound super promising, does it?\n\nAnd yet! Phoenix came out of the gate respectably, going 12-9 against an assortment of Peeps marshmallow animals. I was intrigued, but the Suns\u2019 second quarter promised to be far more challenging. Surely, they would settle in as a frisky but ultimately ceiling-limited team against a tougher schedule.\n\nAnd\u00a0*yet*! The Suns keep on holding serve. At 21-15, they\u2019ve now beaten the Timberwolves (twice), Spurs (twice), Warriors, Lakers (twice), and even the dreaded Thunder. On a night-to-night basis, the Suns can and have beaten almost anyone.\n\nThe way they\u2019re exceeding expectations is what makes this so exciting. If you were one of the few prophets prognosticating a rosy start to the season in the Valley, the vision would have gone something like this: Devin Booker plays at a top-10 level, Green proves to be a competent, efficient sidekick, the mostly-unproven role players tread water in their minutes, and a three-point-powered offense carries them to respectability.\n\nIn the words of Dikembe Mutombo: No, no, no. Booker can\u2019t buy a three-pointer, Green has played 30 minutes all season, the role players are excelling, and the team\u2019s surprisingly stout defense has been the story.\n\nIt starts, as the best tales do, with a villain \u2014 The Villain, to be exact. Dillon Brooks, brought over with Green in the Durant trade, has brought about a much-needed overhaul of Phoenix\u2019s entire vibe, erasing last year\u2019s whinging softness with brass knuckles and\u00a0hilarious pettiness.\n\nPer\u00a0[Cleaning the Glass](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/4258#tab-offensive_overview), Brooks is posting the most efficient shooting season of his career on a whopping 27% usage ([higher than Durant or Anthony Davis](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/players)). He\u2019s nailing\u00a0[46% of his pull-up jumpers](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/pullup?CF=PULL_UP_FGA*GE*7&dir=D&sort=PULL_UP_FG_PCT), a number on par with Kawhi Leonard and Steph Curry, and he\u2019s been unstoppable around the rim. Brooks has shown far more creativity and patience in the paint than I remember (or at least, he\u2019s\u00a0*making*\u00a0them more than I remember). Look at this pretty [two-foot jump-stop/step-through combo](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-suns-arent-who-we-thought-they).\n\nWill he cool off? Probably, but when? The thing about regression is that it rarely happens just because you noticed an outlier. Small-sample statistics operate on their own, unhurried schedule. Maybe Brooks starts missing everything tomorrow; maybe he doesn\u2019t realize he isn\u2019t Tatumless Jaylen Brown from the midrange until the Suns are knee-deep in a second-round playoff battle against an on-their-heels Western juggernaut.\n\nBrooks isn\u2019t a particularly likable chap if he isn't on your team, with his cheap shots and physicality. But if you want mean, he\u2019ll bring the nasty, with a side of freshly-baked headbutts. (Perhaps to a detriment. Brooks\u00a0[leads the league in technical fouls](https://www.foxsports.com/nba/stats?category=misc&sort=tech)\u00a0with a whopping 12; no one else has more than nine. Remember, players start getting suspended for techs after 16! He\u2019s almost certain to start missing games, a loss the Suns can ill afford.)\n\nWhile Brooks\u2019 particular brand of slavering intensity is well-known, few expected it to spread through the rest of the roster like rabies. The entire team has become infected with Brooks\u2019 energy. According to teammate\u00a0[Collin Gillespie on the Young Man and the Three podcas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lz60gfU4IUo&list=PLKfCn7f_hJhA1iOJeloRnJUetVYRdXBQR&index=1)t, it started in training camp, when Brooks incurred two technical fouls during the first team scrimmage with real refs (lol!). Treating practices like games is a coach\u2019s dream, and Brooks set the tone from the start.\n\nHe\u2019s even found a disciple; Gillespie has become\u00a0Villain Jr.\u00a0Gillespie would be a leading candidate for Sixth Man of the Year, but he may lose eligibility after thriving as a starter in Green and Grayson Allen\u2019s injury absences.\n\nOf 150 players averaging at least three catch-and-shoot triples per game, Gillespie sits atop the leaderboard,\u00a0[lacing 52% of his tries](https://www.nba.com/stats/players/catch-shoot?CF=GP*GE*15:CATCH_SHOOT_FGA*GE*3&dir=D&sort=CATCH_SHOOT_FG3_PCT). That\u2019s astounding, even if it\u2019s a skill he\u2019d shown in small flashes previously.\n\nHis work on the other side of the ball has been far more unexpected. Despite his 6\u20192\u201d-on-tiptoes stature and short wingspan, Gillespie has been competitive defensively. He picks up ballhandlers full court, veers around screens with a tight handbrake, and sneaks up on ballhandlers when they\u2019re least expecting it. He gets an insane number of steals [by poking the ball out from behind](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-suns-arent-who-we-thought-they), like a frontcourt Grand Theft Alvarado.\n\nThe Suns\u2019 ninth-ranked defense is nearly five points better defensively\u00a0[with Gillespie on the floor than off](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/5175/onoff#tab-team_efficiency), and that\u2019s despite Gillespie typically being replaced by a defensive hound in Jordan Goodwin.\n\nSpeaking of Goodwin, the longtime Poetry favorite is having a moment. Just a couple of days after\u00a0[talking about how new coach Jordan Ott](https://youtu.be/Lz60gfU4IUo?si=D8cII3f5vuGDsE8Z&t=2530)\u00a0has filled him with confidence (\u201cHe tells me to shoot pull-up treys\u2026 I NEVER heard that until this year!\u201d), Goodwin went out and went a whopping 11-for-17 from deep in a back-to-back against the Thunder and Rockets.\n\nOtt has adroitly weaponized Goodwin\u2019s run-till-the-battery-burns-out energy. Goodwin guards 94 feet, crashes the offensive glass hard (he\u2019s one of the best offensive rebounders in the league, pound-for-pound), and forces a ton of turnovers in his minutes.\n\nOtt deserves a ton of credit for the success of Gillespie, Goodwin, and everyone else. He\u2019s coaxed some redemptive minutes at center from Mark Williams (who was flabbergastingly bad on defense last year but looks like a whole new seven-footer now) and Oso Ighodaro (whom Suns fans wanted to boot into a black hole as recently as November). He\u2019s reinvigorated the woefully underappreciated Royce O\u2019Neale, who keeps drilling triples, playing competent defense against bigger and stronger players, and firing the occasional flashy pass. He\u2019s empowered burgeoning defensive menace Ryan Dunn to do more than just stand in the corner and miss threes, and he\u2019s unlocked the best version of two-way diminutive chaos agent Jamaree Bouyea.\n\nMore tactically, Ott and his staff looked at the Suns and decided to make up for a talent deficit with an emphasis on the NBA\u2019s hottest (and swiftly dwindling) market inefficiency: Winning the possession game.\n\nThe Suns are\u00a0[fifth in offensive rebounding and third in forcing turnovers](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/league/fourfactors). That last stat is particularly wild given that the team doesn\u2019t have many established ballhawks aside from the relatively low-minutes Goodwin, but it\u2019s a swarming defense by committee that relies on pressure and sneaky traps. Nine players are averaging at least 0.9 steals per game (10 if you include Green), and they routinely press full court to speed up and unnerve opposing ballhandlers. Ott is one of a growing number of coaches playing a European-style 10-man rotation most nights, keeping players fresh so they can maintain maximum energy.\n\nOtt has also crafted a solid offense (13th as of this writing) despite a distinct lack of playmakers. He\u2019s leaned heavily on Grayson Allen as an initiator \u2014 and it\u2019s worked! Allen\u2019s averaging 6.7 assists per 100 possessions, half again as many as his previous career high. He\u2019s also notching more than 15 points per game, another career best. 38% from deep is actually the worst mark of Allen\u2019s NBA tenure aside from his rookie season, but he\u2019s doing it on a whopping eight attempts per game. Add to that his nearly two nightly steals, and you\u2019ve got a surprisingly well-rounded contributor.\n\nBut despite Brooks\u2019 and Allen\u2019s big years, the offense still lives and dies with Devin Booker. A down three-pointer hasn\u2019t stopped him from posting a reasonably efficient 25-point scoring average (driven by improved free-throw drawing). He\u2019s as deadly as ever from the midrange, but he\u2019s also become an elite finisher at the rim.\n\nAnd Booker\u2019s passing gets more creative every year. This [through-the-legs chest pass](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-suns-arent-who-we-thought-they) is something you wouldn\u2019t see at the Y, much less in the NBA.\n\nSum it up, and the Suns\u2019 attack is\u00a0[more than five points better with Booker on the floor](https://cleaningtheglass.com/stats/player/344/onoff#tab-team_efficiency)\u00a0than off, a top-quintile number, and is above average with him on the floor overall.\n\nBooker is also one of the few perimeter scorers who doesn\u2019t shy away from the little things. He fights through screens, chases shooters, plays solid help defense, and isn\u2019t afraid to get chippy. Watch him [battle Jabari Smith](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-suns-arent-who-we-thought-they) here.\n\nThat grittiness translates elsewhere, too. Jordan Ott loves to deploy him as an off-ball screener. Wince as [Booker blindsides Russell Westbrook here to spring Gillespie](https://www.basketballpoetry.com/p/the-suns-arent-who-we-thought-they) for a wide-open layup.\n\nA surprising number of analysts I respect think Booker is having a down season, mostly because of his 30% three-point shooting. That\u2019s missing the forest for a particularly ugly tree.\n\nHow far can Booker take this Phoenix team? It\u2019s hard to say. The Suns will still likely have to battle through the play-in thanks to a\u00a0very difficult remaining schedule\u00a0(although there are a couple of teams in the West\u2019s current top six who could be vulnerable \u2014 looking at you, Lakers). Phoenix feels top-heavy, and an injury to Booker or Brooks at the wrong time could spell doom. A lack of a real power forward has and will hurt them against the Denvers and Houstons of the world.\n\nAnd internally, the Jalen Green question is looming over everything. Green is a talented but inconsistent shotmaker who has incrementally improved every season but still looks the part of an empty-calories gunner. That won\u2019t fly under Ott for the long-term, and the team will need to make a tough decision on a limited sample: The trade deadline is just a month away, and the Suns have no idea if Green can do, well, anything.\n\nPhoenix desperately needs another secondary scorer, but they\u2019ve also built up their wins with a blue-collar attitude not typically associated with the high-flyer. They would absolutely part with Green if another front office coveted him, but I\u2019m not sure he has too much trade value right now. The team didn\u2019t draft Green and owes him nothing beyond an opportunity to prove himself. The smart bet might be keeping him. At worst, he can be an emergency break-glass bench scorer, while the best-case scenarios still involve All-Star potential.\n\nBefore the season,\u00a0[Ishbia had said](https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/draymond-green-changes-tune-dillon-182612332.html)\u00a0he wanted a new Suns team with \u201csome grit, some determination, some work ethic, some grind, some joy. We just haven\u2019t had that.\u201d The sweat mentality is certainly there: Kenny Atkinson recently said the Suns were\u00a0the hardest-working team in the league. The carefree joy of exceeding expectations is present, too ([\u201cOn live TV, bro?\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W0uOfLcoNm8)). This is a tough, good, and fun team.\n\nThe national media might have chortled at the early implementation of Ishbia\u2019s dream. Ain\u2019t nobody laughing at the Suns now.",

    "text": "Official /r/nba Power Rankings #5 (12.29.2025). [24/30 rankers reporting this week.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PBF52w8vs3VjgU1tDYClTzxOYbCY1-hisA6ZS0HopHo/edit?usp=sharing) /R/NBA's Power Rankings are published every two weeks which is a bit different from most rankings.  Other than that we rank the teams the same way as our competition. If write ups are left blank the team rep decided not to submit. We encourage any user to fill in the blanks in the comment section. Please follow /u/powerrankingsnba to see this more on your feed!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\\#\t|\tTeam\t|\t\u0394\t|\tRecord\t|\tComment\t|\n--: \t|\t:--\t|\t:--\t|\t:-:\t|\t:--\t|\n1\t|\t[](/OKC) Thunder\t|\t--\t|\t27-5\t|\tHappy holidays everyone! The Thunder are showing cracks in the armor!!!! Continuing from my blurb from Power Rankings #4, the Thunder added losses to Minnesota and back-to-back losses to San Antonio in their last 5 games (going 3-3 in this cycle). I think there is some discourse that the Thunder have been solved. And I think that is certainly the case because the flaws that the Spurs are able to exploit are the same flaws that both Indiana and Denver were able to exploit last season: 1. elite ball handling + limited turnovers (Fox/Castle/Harper, Jokic/Murray, Haliburton/whatever wizardry Carlisle had going) 2. elite defensive strategy (Wembanyama, Denver zone that we couldn't crack, Pascal+Turner w/ elite perimeter defense) and 3. poor 3 point shooting from Thunder players (literally anyone on OKC in every loss played like ass loool). The result of those 3 things forces OKC to become a half court offense who isn't able to take advanta of its strengths as an opportunistic defense. Shai is a very good half court player, but when defenses are able to key in on him, and him alone - he will wear down eventually (though probably still get you a solid-ish 30). These losses to the Spurs (and Indy+Denver) are good reminders that this Thunder squad still has another level to go which can only be obtained if/when JDub is able to take the leap as a consistent secondary creator (though the emergence of Ajay Mitchell has helped here quite a bit). All in all, it doesn't feel good that the Thunder were humbled the way that they were, however I don't think anything that has happened is surprising or has shown any new problems that haven't been problems since last year. If anything, I'm glad that these problems reared their head as obviously, and embarassingly as they did early in the season so that this can become an intense point of emphasis as the team looks for areas of improvement going into the future. \t|\n2\t|\t[](/SAS) Spurs\t|\t+4\t|\t23-8\t|\tWell, I felt a lot better about ranking the Spurs at #1 before that faceplant at home against the Jazz. I mulled pretty hard back and forth between the Spurs, Thunder, Knicks, Pistons and Nuggets before landing here (a little homerism never hurt nobody anyway, and all five teams have compelling reasons to not be ranked #1 at the moment so c'est la vie). In any event, Spurs fans have to be *buzzin* after the last two weeks that the Spurs have had. The Spurs are now the only team in the NBA to be ranked in the top-5 of ORtg and DRtg (though they rank \"only\" fifth in both), and the three headed PG monster of Fox, Castle and Harper have been a revelation in the basketball world. Taking a page from OKC and Indiana in last year's playoffs, it turns out having too many players comfortable with handling the ball and initiating the offense *isn't* a bad thing after all. There will come a time where we probably won't want to be paying max contracts to three players who have similar skillsets (not to mention the max we'll be paying to the 7'5\" Alien in the middle), but we won't have to cross that bridge for another four years. Speaking of our 7'5\" Alien, Wemby is BACK y'all. It's been really gratifying to see him ease himself back into the offense that enabled the Spurs to go 9-3 during his calf strain, and the offense doesn't seem to have faltered much, even with his reintroduction. Though his minutes restriction has been frustrating to follow, he re-entered the team's starting lineup against the Jazz and hit 28 minutes, an auspicious sign for the future. His defense remains as fantastic as ever--the Spurs have climbed from 16th in the league in DRtg just before he returned all the way up to the aforementioned 5th (with a DRtg of 106.2 as a team) since his return. The Spurs will have a chance at a few revenge games before hitting a particulalry grueling stretch of B2Bs: they have CLE, NYK, @IND & POR (B2B), @MEM & LAL (B2B), @BOS & @MIN (B2B).\t|\n3\t|\t[](/DEN) Nuggets\t|\t-1\t|\t22-9\t|\tHappy Holidays y'all! Turns out the Nuggets found a lump of coal in their stocking and tossed it on the ground just for Cam Johnson to trip on it, adding yet another player to the injury list. Thank fuck for THJ, Bruce and Val, otherwise we'd be looking at Julian Strawther and Zeke Nnaji starter minutes and committing actual basketball atrocities each night. Injuries notwithstanding, it's been the Jokic and Murray show the past two weeks, with some up-and-down performances highlighted by the heart stopping OT win on Christmas Day against the Wolves. Hopefully the team can continue treading water until the missing starters can return.\t|\n4\t|\t[](/DET) Pistons\t|\t--\t|\t24-8\t|\t\t|\n5\t|\t[](/NYK) Knicks\t|\t--\t|\t22-9\t|\tHappy Hanukkah, Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year. No fancy reflection on the past year from me this time. The Knicks are kicking ass, are better than their record- despite some sloppy wins- and better than the Pistons. Coaching has clicked, players have clicked, end-of-bench guys have stepped up big, and the vibes are focused. Call those you love these next couple days and tell them how much you love them. Life is short and your relationships make you who you are. Be grateful, graceful, and kind. Peace.\t|\n6\t|\t[](/HOU) Rockets\t|\t-3\t|\t19-10\t|\tA mixed bag these past couple of weeks. Unexpected losses to the Pelicans, Kings, and Clippers, as well as heartbreak against the Nuggets, put Ime Udoka under heat for his offensive schemes, as well as reigniting concerns that something more may be needed at the point. Nevertheless, the team has recovered with two quality wins over the Cavs and Lakers. It'd be lovely to say that DFS and Tari Eason are all the team needed to get back to winning ways, but as much respect as one can put on those names, I thknk the teams, and particularly the guards, will have some questions to answer before the trade deadline.\t|\n7\t|\t[](/BOS) Celtics\t|\t+2\t|\t19-12\t|\tJaylen Brown now has 9 straight games with 30 or more points, tying a little known Celtic legend named Larry Bird. The Celtics next game is against the Jazz, which means he'll probably go for 13 points cause nothing is predictable with the Celtics. Since the last rankings they've gone 4-2, with wins over the Heat, Raptors, and Pacers twice, and losses to the Pistons and Trailblazers. Beyond Jaylen Brown's streak, role players continue to be standouts for the Celtics. Rookie 1st round pick Hugo Gonzalez is coming into his own, Luka Garza is continuing to be a streaky but solid bench big that is shooting 42.9% from deep on the year, and Sam Hauser is starting to remember that he can shoot after an absolutely dreadful November that saw him shoot 31% from the field and only 27.5% from deep. With a little over a month until the trade deadline, rumors have swirled like crazy linking the Celtics to practically any big man with a pulse. Ivica Zubac seems like the dream scenario, but reports keep on saying the Clippers aren't interested in shopping him yet. Lord knows what the next month will hold though. Between now and the next rankings the Celtics will play 7 times, with matchups against the Jazz, Kings, Clippers, Bulls, Nuggets, Raptors, and Spurs. We'll probably somehow play the Nuggets and Spurs down to the buzzer if not blow one of them out, only to turn around and get blown out by one of the Jazz/Kings/Clippers just to continue the maximum chaos. \t|\n8\t|\t[](/MIN) TWolves\t|\t--\t|\t20-12\t|\tWolves are going to Wolves. Days later from taking down OKC and taking the Nuggets to OT on Christmas the Wolves get ran off the court at home VS Brooklyn. Whether it's ego or unprofessionalism the team just picks and chooses when they'll show up to play. That level of play will probably leave the team in a disappointing spot come the spring if they dont change it. Whether its internal or a roster change something needs to change in order for this team to reach their stated goals for the season. |\n9\t|\t[](/LAL) Lakers\t|\t-2\t|\t20-10\t|\t\t|\n10\t|\t[](/PHX) Suns\t|\t+2\t|\t18-13\t|\tThe hardest 14-game stretch for arguably any team this season is finally over. OKC (x2), Spurs (x1), Nuggets (x1), Lakers (x3), Timberwolves (x2), Rockets (x2), Warriors (x2), Kings (x1). All while Green hasn\u2019t played, Booker, Brooks, Grayson, plus several others all missed multiple games. Not even close to 100% against the gauntlet of the West (plus SAC). We went 7-7 and will end 2025 well over .500. That's a massive success and now I can confidently say this team is for real. We aren\u2019t contenders, but the record is not a fluke. The schedule lightens up and it will be up to the team to stay *\u22c6\uff61\u00b0\u2729 Aligned\u2729\u00b0\uff61\u22c6* and not to get complacent. Also, we've played only 2/31 games against the East so far. Weird.\t|\n12\t|\t[](/ORL) Magic\t|\t-2\t|\t18-14\t|\tMan do we miss Franz and Suggs right now, defense has taken a huge hit over the last few weeks and the offense is sputtering. Doesn't help when Paolo is very clearly not in the right state physically or mentally. Not sure if the groin is still botheirng him or he's scared to get injured again after also suffering a core injury last year with the oblique tear. In either case, he needs to get right if the Magic are going to be making any noise the rest of the year. They've managed to get up to the 4th seed with an \"easy\" schedule through January. Anthony Black has been a revelation in his third year, putting him clearly into 6MOTY or MIP conversations. Really excited to see how much more this kid grows the rest of his career.\t|\n12\t|\t[](/TOR) Raptors\t|\t+2\t|\t19-14\t|\tAll I asked Santa for Christmas this year was a healthy RJ. It was promising to see him return in a win. \t|\n13\t|\t[](/MIA) Heat\t|\t-2\t|\t17-15\t|\tThe Heat have gone 3-4 in the last two weeks. Another rough stretch where the offense has really struggled. Herro has been hurt this whole time, and even Bam missed two games. On the good side, the defense has still been solid and some of our younger guys have been stepping up. Ware has looked amazing lately and has become our best shooter somehow (47% from three is nuts). Jovic and Pelle finally returned and both have played great over the last two. Jakucionas, our rookie, has finally gotten into the rotation and has looked good so far. He seems to have taken the Fonteccio role for now, and his shooting, passing, and defense all look great. Bam, on the other hand, has really struggled on offense this year. We need to get him going somehow, and we need to find a way to improve the offense in general. Spo has some tough decisions to make when Herro comes back on how to maximize this offense. I think our potential is high but right now we are nothing more than a middle of the pack team unfortunately. \t|\n14\t|\t[](/PHI) 76ers\t|\t-1\t|\t16-14\t|\tGood news everyone! The Sixers \"Big 3\" has been back on the court together in a more regular fashion! Bad news! They haven't won yet! It is kind of phenomenal that one of the worst stretches this season by the Sixers comes when all of their max contracts have been on the floor. The worst part is it can't even be completely chalked up to a tough schedule, they've lost some incredible brain benders to teams they have demolished in the past. The truly puzzling part is the players on an individual basis haven't even been that bad. Maxey has had some cold nights, and we just have to accept PG is what he is nowadays, but for the most part \"The Process\" has been solid and the other pieces are working too. This season has been shaping up very positively for all preseason expectations, but then these stretches make you wonder if the bottom will fall out at any minute. With a growing resentment around Nurse by the fanbase as well, this winter will absolutely ask some hard questions to the Sixers about themselves. \t|\n15\t|\t[](/GSW) Warriors\t|\t+2\t|\t16-16\t|\tJust when Warriors started to roll off a few wins and move up the standings either their easy schedule they have a nuclear meltdown in OT because the Raptors ran a high school-esq full court press. Warriors have been able to keep games close this year but have trouble closing.\tDraymond has been particularly polarizing lately with Kerr, Jimmy and the armchair reddit crowd. Should be a drama free 2026 from this Warriors squad. |\n16\t|\t[](/CLE) Cavaliers\t|\t-1\t|\t17-16\t|\tThe Cavs went 2-4 since the last power rankings. I chose not to watch us play the rockets on Saturday, as in, I wasn\u2019t doing anything but still didn\u2019t watch the Cavs. I haven\u2019t chosen to not watch a game in what has to be over a decade. I needed a break. Maybe it\u2019s part of the cope of hoping this team turns on the jets when it gets later in the season. The team is way underperforming to this point on the season (for instance, shooting just 34.9% from 3 after being second in the league last year) and surely will improve as players health improve and lineups start to gel again\u2026 but that needs to start showing soon.\t|\n17\t|\t[](/MEM) Grizzlies\t|\t+1\t|\t15-17\t|\tThe team continues to flirt with mediocrity, edging closer and closer to the 0.500 record but never able to obtain it. Ja has returned, and has looked good in the few games he's played. It's easy to be optimistic, but looking closely at the schedule shows a nightmarish 2026 that will be difficult to maintain play-in pace. The light at the end of the tunnel is our lord and savior Zach Edey, who appears to be eyeing a January return. Cedric Coward continues to show flashes and aught to remain an All-Rookie favorite. Above all us, I'm just ready to have more than 2 guards on the roster again.\t|\n18\t|\t[](/CHI) Bulls\t|\t+4\t|\t15-16\t|\tI hate how this team makes me believe. Win streak, Losing streak, Win streak, losing streak. And then we end up in the play-in just like every other year. But no matter how much I try to think logically, no matter how much I try to convince myself that this will only lead to the play-in, no matter how hard I try, I can't help but believe. I believe that Buzelis will continue to gain more confidence inside the arc. I believe Giddey will continue to make crazy passes look easy. I believe that Tre Jones will continue to dominate on defense. I believe Ayo will continue to drive and lay that ball in like it's nothing. I believe Patrick Williams will continue to be ass. I believe that the October Bulls are back. I don't know how long they're staying, but the emphasis on getting inside with the overall increase in effort on defense has revived my hopes for this team. The double-big lineup of Stix and Collins is an amazing thing to watch, and Tre Jones seems to be playing like he was a month ago. Everybody is healthy, and it has birthed another fun-to-watch Bulls team. But the question is whether we can maintain this hot streak. Our defense, though better, is still awful. A game where we get 152 points in regulation should never be close. We were making awful decisions on D in that Bucks game. But then again, our offense has been great. I don't wanna say definitively that we're back yet, but if we're still winning by the next power rankings, I think it's time we start having conversations. \t|\n19\t|\t[](/ATL) Hawks\t|\t-3\t|\t15-18\t|\tOh no, we suck again! While the instinctive response to this 2-10 stretch for some might be to blame the downturn solely on Trae's return from injury, things were already going poorly before he came back. [On November 18th, the Atlanta Hawks had a net rating of +2.7 (13th)](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced?DateFrom=&DateTo=11/18/2025&dir=A&sort=NET_RATING). Since then, [the Hawks have a -4.3 net rating (23rd)](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced?DateFrom=11/19/2025&DateTo=&dir=A&sort=NET_RATING). The glaring issue is the defense. While the offense has mainly held steady across the two samples (114.7 (18th)  --> 114.5 (17th)), the defense has fallen off a cliff, going from 112 (8th) all the way to 118.8 (26th). Trae isn't a good defender, but he's only played 5/18 games in that sample. There's some deeper issues going on. The two biggest cuplrits are the center rotation and Jalen. Onyeka Okongwu is a good center, but with KP and Dante out [he is getting run into the ground](https://np.reddit.com/r/AtlantaHawks/comments/1px22gx/okongwu_is_being_run_into_the_ground_hes_already/) with [how many minutes he's being forced to play](https://www.statmuse.com/nba/ask/most-minutes-played-by-players-at-center). The problem is that we don't really have any other good options on the roster. Mo Gueye is a great defender at the 4 who's still learning to playing center, and Asa Newell has been a disaster on defense. We finally have a second player listed as a center after signing Malik Williams to a two-way, but until (if) KP comes back I expect that Quin will be playing OO heavy minutes. The other glaring defensive issue is Jalen. As much praise as Jalen has (deservedly) gotten for his offensive leap, his defensive impact has taken a massive step back this season. Part of this is due to not having Clint Capela directing things behind him + the revolving door at center, but that alone doesn't fully explain the drop off from last season. This team needs him to at least be a neutral defender, especially if he and Trae are going to share the court long term.\t|\n20\t|\t[](/MIL) Bucks\t|\t-1\t|\t13-19\t|\tGiannis is back now, and the team did juuuuuuuust well enough without him to keep the season afloat. We've got a soft stretch of schedule coming up and need to capitalize on that to get back in the playoff picture, and Doc's old ass should absolutely be on the hot seat if we don't. Also, don't hold your breath expecting a Giannis trade to happen, because it won't this season (and you can take that to the bank).\t|\n21\t|\t[](/POR) Trail Blazers\t|\t--\t|\t13-19\t|\t\t|\n22\t|\t[](/DAL) Mavericks\t|\t-2\t|\t12-21\t|\t\t|\n23\t|\t[](/BKN) Nets\t|\t+2\t|\t10-19\t|\tThe Nets have the best defense in the league in the month of December and have went 7-3 in their last ten. Coach Jordi makes it hard to tank as he puts players in their ideal position to succeed. MPJ is having his best season yet with a rotation including 4 rookies with varying amounts of play time. Still, I would expect them to start losing games as their schedule toughens up slightly. Regardless, it has been fun seeing the team thrive on the back of young talent and we'll see how they continue to fare as the season goes on.  \t|\n24\t|\t[](/LAC) Clippers\t|\t+3\t|\t10-21\t|\tIn a shocking turn of events, the dead-to-right Clippers have somehow found themselves with the longest current winning streak in the league. As it stands, that streak has only moved us up 1 spot in the West, but I think I speak for every Clipper fan when I say I just want to see a semblance of winning basketball this season. Kawhi  has been playing like someone owes him money (brother had 55???), spearheading our offense while Zubac is out for a couple of weeks. We currently are starting 37 year old Brook Lopez at center and, for some reason, it has been working. It may be fleeting, as our current roster is already as fragile as you can get, but we are finally playing serious basketball and the players look like they have realized the position that they're in. I pray that we keep this fight going for the rest of the year, but for now I'm just happy we're watchable at the moment.\t|\n25\t|\t[](/CHA) Hornets\t|\t-2\t|\t11-20\t|\tI was reminded this week, watching Christmas NBA games, that the only franchise to never play on Christmas happened to be my team. Reflecting on that I went through a long list of failures, disparate in nature, but all pointing to one conclusion: Charlotte just will never have nice things. We had the team clicking, on a 5-5 ten game swing, Kon/Miller/LaMelo building real chemistry together and getting some real victories, and then, of course, Kon sprains his ankle on a routine play in Orlando. The team is just never going to be fully clicking. It's deflating following this team, they always kill your hope. On the basketball front though, I'm very impressed with the Kon/Melo chemistry and think the team needs to be built around that moving forward. A consequence of this is , sell your Kalkbrenner stock. He's nowhere near as good as Diabate and is getting exposed on defense now. Sell your Kalkbrenner stock, you can't play his style of defense with Melo/Kon as perimeter defenders. He's also a total weakness inside and doesn't rebound with any force or explosiveness. Im out on Kalkbrenner and you should be too. Until the team improves its awful frontcourt, top 8 picks is where we shall reside.\t|\n26\t|\t[](/UTA) Jazz\t|\t-2\t|\t12-19\t|\tTo tank, or not to tank, that is the question. As of today, the Jazz are sitting at the 9th best odds at the #1 draft pick, which is trending towards going to OKC if trends continue. The Jazz have never gone into the lottery and had their own pick improved, so Jazz fans aren't banking on that happening. In order for us to keep our pick, we need to start losing more games. Our front office hasn't fully decided which way they want to lean, and it makes the decision tougher when Keyonte George is averaging 30 pts/game his last 8 games, which has the Jazz at 4-4 in that same time frame. Danny Ainge needs to kick it into gear and either push for the play-in, or push for a top 5 pick.\t|\n27\t|\t[](/NOP) Pelicans\t|\t+1\t|\t8-25\t|\tLet it be known there was a stretch in December 2025 where the Pelicans technically were the team on the longest winning streak. Something is cooking with Zion off the bench, though probably nothing more than a showcase prior to a trade. The roster is clearly drifting toward Derik Queen as the long-term answer \u2014 not because he\u2019s perfect, but because he plays, competes, and looks like he actually wants to be here \u2014 with Jeremiah Fears flashing just enough to keep people watching. Fans still don\u2019t want to trade Trey Murphy III or Herb Jones, Willie Green is gone, the offense looks better under Borrego, and none of it really matters. At some point this stops being a rebuild and starts being a holding pattern.\t|\n28\t|\t[](/SAC) Kings\t|\t+1\t|\t8-24\t|\t\t|\n29\t|\t[](/WAS) Wizards\t|\t+1\t|\t7-23\t|\t\"Verbal meme: Stringer Bell in The Wire: \u201cI want you to put the word out there that we back up\"\". Washington has feasted in the month of December, taking advantage of the lack of center depth from their opposition leading to 4 wins. It isn't much but it does matter to us. Are we inevitably screwed when the trade deadline comes around and Marvin Bagley III is gone, removing a core piece of depth that other teams simply don't have? Yes. Will we also be hanging the banner of having a winning streak? You're god damn right.\n\"\t|\n30\t|\t[](/IND) Pacers\t|\t-3\t|\t6-26\t|\tThings have officially gone from bad to worse. Indiana is in the midst of an 8-game skid, finding themselves at the very bottom of the league standings. The kind-of-good defensive stretch has evaporated, and now the Pacers are back to doing pretty much nothing well again. As Caitlin Cooper astutely observed the other night: the biggest problem for the Pacers is that they never experience the same problem. Some nights it's turnovers, sometimes it's defense. One thing remains constant though: Indiana's offense is putrid, and by some marks is statistically one of the least efficient this century. All will be worth it though if the ping-pong balls fall correctly this summer....\t|",

Russ still has the lead over him in the regular season with 180 but he \u201conly\u201d has 25 playoff techs.\n\nThis moved Draymond up to 8th all time in career Technical Fouls.

It would thus require the inclusion of another big contract \u2014 i.e., Green ($25.8 million). Yet as Warriors coach Steve Kerr said publicly last week, and team sources confirmed, a move like that is not in their plans.\n\n> A Butler-for-Davis swap works financially, as the Warriors forward also makes $54.1 million this season, but Golden State has shown no interest in making such a move. While team sources say the Warriors have not entirely closed the door on a Davis deal, it appears unlikely. What\u2019s more, it should be noted that the Mavericks called Golden State about the Davis possibility \u2014 and not the other way around.\n\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6931252/2025/12/31/nba-trade-rumors-lakers-warriors-clippers-hawks-bucks/?source=user_shared_article",

Helped us win 4 chips, DPOY, helped a dynasty, never left or quit when things got bad. His decision making and temper has been the problem, of course, and it\u2019s a shame if even OG fans want him gone but idk if Steph or Kerr are gonna let him go. He\u2019s getting older, angrier, and just not been playing well recently, but of course he is a franchise legend and as much as everyone hates him, I would still be a bit sad to see him go cuz I\u2019ve been there thru it all. I know people may hate this take but I genuinely don\u2019t know if certain people like our best player or coach will advocate for this trade. Curry would be heartbroken and idk if he\u2019ll play the same, but it may be for the better of this team.\n\nBtw, I understand if people think it\u2019s dramatic from the standpoint that curry would be \u201cheartbroken\u201d or whatever but I was talking more from a personal standpoint. Ofc if we get AD and win that\u2019s great, but also the FO said Jimmy or dray won\u2019t be getting moved, so idk what\u2019s gonna happen.",

Real chance to make some ground on the teams behind and potentially move up. Then buy at the deadline or even after the 15th. Huge month of January.\n\nDray\u2019s obviously in a rough patch but irrespective of that.. the big three\u2019s advanced metrics are still elite. \n\nI think the bench/ role players need this work on the trade market. The middle of the rotation are criminally inconsistent. Get me 8 guys we can trust for a playoff run. \n\n34 m\u2019s between Jk and Hield. Lots of paths to take. Lacob and Mike have no excuse this deadline in terms of getting better, even if it\u2019s not that much better.\n\nGo Dubs!",

Contrary to many of his defenders' arguments, it would not have been *impossible* to win without him, but it would have required substantial changes in our style of play on both ends of the courts.\n\nSecond, because of his unique combination of talents and the frequent negative impacts of his childish, emotional behavior, there has always been a question in my mind as to whether we could trade him and get a good value in return. If we could have, we could have adjusted our style and been as good as before, maybe better. But if we had to \"dump\" him, then we would certainly have been a worse team than we were before.\n\nNow, I'd be happy if we could get some half-decent players on expiring contracts for the salary match and a decent draft pick for him. He's not winning games for us, and he's just as much a jackass as ever.",

    "text": "To All Dray Hatters\u2026. Been seeing a lot of hate aimed at Dray in this sub lately, and it\u2019s giving me serious flashbacks to the way people piled on Klay during his last season here. Back then, Klay actually had a solid 3PT shooting year, but because the playoffs didn\u2019t go how anyone wanted, the online discourse turned into nonstop slander.\n\nSame pattern with Dray right now: people are anchoring hard to the most recent stretch and acting like that\u2019s the whole story.\n\nLook at the plot I\u2019m posting with this. Since December, yeah \u2014 his plus/minus has been rough. No argument. But that\u2019s exactly the point: recent hasn\u2019t been great, so the sub is treating him like he\u2019s washed and needs to be traded yesterday.\n\nWhat gets ignored is that before December, he was legitimately having a strong season. A lot of games were positive +/-, and there were nights where he was one of the biggest \u201cwinning factors\u201d on the floor \u2014 sometimes even leading the team in plus/minus. That doesn\u2019t happen if you\u2019re \u201cdone.\u201d That happens when you\u2019re still impacting winning in the ways Dray always has: defense, communication, quarterbacking, pushing tempo, making the right reads.\n\nAnd context matters. The schedule grind + the injuries + lineup instability in December absolutely plays into this stuff. (Not excuses \u2014 context.) If you\u2019re only watching box score vibes and the last couple weeks, you\u2019ll miss how much his presence still changes the team when he\u2019s right.\n\nSo to the \u201ctrade Dray\u201d crowd: I get being frustrated, but let\u2019s not pretend this dude isn\u2019t a core reason we have four banners. He\u2019s not some random contract you dump when things get noisy. If anything, what he needs is support (and the team getting healthier/settled) so we can get him back closer to that November form.\n\nDon\u2019t let a bad month make you forget who Draymond Green is.",

A Draymond with fresh legs is still a menace. \n\nThe other issue is that our roster construction isn't great right now, it's unbalanced. So how and where do you play Draymond so he's most effective? \n\nI want Draymond to retire a Warrior but at the same time if Draymond's salary is required to bring back a true high impact player I'd be OK with it.",

    "text": "So I see a couple of arguments here.  Some that Dray is in a slump, some that he's playing out of position or the wrong role, some that we should remember his contributions to four past rings.  I think I take exception with most of them.\n\nFirst, we can love what Dray brought, and still have a problem with what he is bringing.  \n\n2. He's playing out of position/role because of Kerr.  But Kerr isn't going to change, so should management change the tools to force the coach to change?  One of Dray or Kerr has to change. Not necessarily moved/traded/fired, but something different from what's currently being done. \n\n3.  Pretty close to the halfway point, and a slump in the West can cost you a top 6.  A slump that drags on too long could cost you the play-in.\n\nAll that said most important in my mind is that Dray is unreliable.  We will never be able to know for sure if he's going to freak out in a playoff game, and get tossed.  Ejections and mental lapses while screaming at refs have cost the team enough.  I appreciate all he's done, but at some point we all get to feel like we're tired of seeing him do that.  Add that to a slump or regression, and add that to the potential to make a drastic roster improvement, and it's only fair to talk about trading him.",

    "text": "Draymond. Draymond makes about the same as Tobias Harris (Harris is expiring this year).\n\nAs far as i know, Tobias is a good vibes guy. Remember those ads with Boban? (Also, is Boban still playing? Can we get him to at least try to annoy Jokic, Chet/Hartenstein, Steven Adams/Sengun, the gauntlet of bigs at the top of the west)\n\nDraymond - 94 offensive rating, 111 defensive rating.\n\nTobias - 119 offensive rating, 115 defensive rating.\n\n  \nIt would be cold to trade 4x champ Draymond Green, and I'm not even saying they should, I'm just putting this out there for discussion.. \n\n\n\nDetroit is finally good again, Draymond is a Michigan guy.. Historically, Detroit seems like a great team for bad vibes guys\n\n\n\nHarris is expiring this year, i don't know what having $26M come off your books even means in 2025...\n\n  \nAnd lastly, Klay is gone so why not try something new around Steph? Clearly he did okay at the Olympics without Klay and Draymond, so maybe this guy is a hooper and he can figure it out?\n\n  \nI'm not even saying this because he got ejected tonight. I think he was mad because everyone is allowed to throw Steph around, and honestly, trading him for Tobias Harris might leave Steph even more exposed to this treatment, like when Chicago traded Charles Oakley for Bill Cartwright. Can you imagine those Detroit series if Oakley is there going nose to nose with the Bad Boys? Jordan might have won in 89 and 90! Kinda funny that the perfect trade is probably Draymond for Dillon Brooks, can't have them on the same team probably but Brooks is standing up to LeBron AND contributing on offense.. one of those guys you hate until they're on your team.. but of course now he is way too important to Phoenix..\n\n  \nI think maybe I'd almost rather do Draymond for Tobias and see what happens in the off season with that money available than gut the team and future for Giannis, although I do think Steph+Giannis+Jimmy and role players stepping up could actually make the Finals this year, especially if we could climb into 5th. I think Giannis is the antidote to what the Thunder are doing... but we're not getting Giannis LOL",

TOs are cleaned up, and they play much better.\n\nJust bc Dray has a couple of bad regular-season games doesn't prove anything. Steph already had games scoring less than 15 pts or less, looking tired for being old, but no one says anything.\n\nIt's pretty clear these two just need more support so they don't have to backpack every time and get worn out.\n\nI trust they're still able to show up when the time comes, given we have real support.\n\nYou're not looking at the solution the right way.\n\nThe best thing to do is to bench Dray (Iggy style), cut his regular-season minutes from 35 min to 25 min.\n\nOur real issue is our SG, Center, and wing depth. We can get away with some of our wings, but our guards and centers have been inconsistent.\n\nTJD and Post are bench players; they get picked on constantly as starters. Having a real rim-protecting big solves a lot (Gafford, Claxton).\n\nMoody/Buddy/Melton have been inconsistent and disappointing. Richard and GP2 did so much better in their roles today. This just proves we need an actual SG starter or a wing that can 3 and D.\n\nJK/Moody/TJD/Buddy = 45m tradeable salary. There's 0 trust these guys will step up in the playoffs and stop a Sengun or Wemby shot attempt, but Dray will.\n\nYou find a rim-protecting Big and a 3-and-D SG/Wing, and we're good. Dray can come off the bench, Curry and Jimmy have better spacing and rim protection.",

They are currently 13-12 and if the postseason started today they'd be in the play-in tournament with teams like the Suns, Grizzlies and Trail Blazers.*\n\n*This is not where a star-studded veteran team with high expectations probably thought they would be at this point in the season, which is why they are constantly finding themselves in trade rumors as fans and the media dream about which unhappy star on another team could make them a contender again.*\n\n*In order to make a big move they'd have to be willing to part with at least one of their current stars. We know that Stephen Curry isn't going anywhere, but what about Draymond Green? Drafted by Golden State in 2013, Green has won four titles with the Warriors and they don't want to see him in another uniform.*\n\n*Unless...*\n\n*According to insider Jake Fischer, there is one player who the Warriors would trade Green away to aquire.*\n\n*\"The only player I think in the league that Golden State would be willing to move Draymond Green for is Giannis Antetokounmpo,\" said Fischer. \"That\u2019s the only player. Between him and Jonathan Kuminga and Brandin Podziemski, all of a sudden Golden State probably does have an intriguing package if you're Milwaukee. But I don't think that they are going to be pushing Draymond's salary onto the table, or Jimmy Butler\u2019s salary, for anyone short of him.\"*\n\n*Fischer also said it was unlikely that the Warriors would trade for Zach LaVine or Lauri Markkanen because they would have to give up Green or Jimmy Butler.\u201d*\n\nI wouldn\u2019t want Markkanen or Lavine. \n\nGo get Giannis!!!",

If we weren't better without him this would be a bigger deal.\n\nHopefully this is finally when the coaches realize that he is at best a role player on this team. The offense opens up so much when he's not on the floor, while the defense really doesn't suffer.\n\nThe psychological boost of good offense spills over to defense; it's just easier to play hard nose defense when you're scoring. Conversely, it's really hard to get stops when offense is a grind. The easier one side of the game is, the easier the other gets. You can see it when the team has five non-Draymonds on the floor.\n\nSo it's no surprise that they play great team defense when they're not effectively playing four on five on offense and turning the ball over.",

Draymond is only going to be desirable to teams who think they have a win now ready team that just needs another piece to get over the hump, like the Lakers who surely can score the ball but have trouble getting stops. \n\nI love Draymond and have always been a huge fan through his ups and his downs but if it brings back Giannis I have to admit I'd be OK with it. Sad about it, but OK with it. Maybe he and Steph would come do one more year with the Warriors on or near vet minimums with Giannis and whoever else the Warriors can get on their roster with cleared cap space and have one last hurrah at the very end of their careers. \n\nHaving said that I truly don't believe Giannis wants to come to the Warriors, I think his heart is set on a New York or LA type big market, or even Boston or Chicago. He probably views the Warriors roster as too old at the top without enough good young talent.",

That\u2019s on him at this point. \n\nAlso, a huge part of growing up is that people can\u2019t read your mind, it\u2019s on you to tell others how you feel. So for KD to isolate himself and sit back and wait on everyone, even though he was in the right, is not good either.

There was that moment in the Portland game when he threw the ball away 3 times in a row on some terribly sloppy passes - and then screamed at Post. He\u2019s in denial about the erosion of his skills. But he can still play great D, for short stretches. And a non-scoring 5 who plays great D and rebounds well is perfectly acceptable.

Kuminga has never played well at PF, he's always been better suited as small forward both offensively and especially defensively.  Horford is out.  Gui is doing awesome in this second half energizer bunny role, but start him?  Seriously?  You can't go two headed monster with Post and TJD or you'll not have anything at C when they're resting.  That leaves making Butler die by starting at PF for 50 games (\"Come on Butler, get that MF Julius Randle!\") or go with our technically best defensive PF... GP2 (I wish I was totally kidding).  If you want to bench Draymond, that trade absolutely has to be a PF.",

They all have a year and a half left on their contracts so they are not bad contracts, and the pick would be nice.\n\nTrade Kuminga and filler to the heat for Wiggins.\n\nWiggins and MPJ would make this team much more fun to watch and solve a huge issue, one of which is Kerry's line ups, as this would shrink the roster's bad possible line ups, give more size and shooting as these trades would mean a few less guards.",

If you noticed his APG dropping over the years, it's because it's become more and more allowable to just foul tf out of Steph off ball, this makes it harder for the Dray + Steph duo. \n\nDray plays great defense regardless, his communication and getting players in position off-ball defense is key to most of our stops. There's an noticeable different with and without Dray on the court defensively.",
