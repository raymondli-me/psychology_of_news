Free throws up, every one can drive and get to the paint or rim at will, because of a rule change that makes it so the defender literally cannot cut off or reroute the ball handler's drive.\n\nWhy did the league pass in 2018-19 (Morey/Myers), but then why did the league allow d again for a year and a half, and now we're back to you can't deter drives anymore. It's like a fake sport.\n\nScoring is up across the board, as our free throw's, the league also changed the rule where you can't high five the hand on a shot, meaning you have to give a shooter an uncontested shot, or you can go up and fake contest, but if you graze their hand, or they kick out again it's throws.",

Kerr is stuck in the past and coaching off nostalgia and not today's game. Today's game is faster, bigger, and more physical. To where those guys that was in the organization, got thrown out when they can't pass as well as Kerr loves(Wisemen anybody) and fail to stick with youngsters that they drafted for aging players that can't stay healthy or not as good to help relieve Curry from being the constant #1 scorer. Kerr need to develop youngsters let them play through mistakes and encourage them to shoot more and play through slumps if they are not scoring efficiently. Making them figure it out and be ok with the results. I believe we got size but don't encourage them to do anything else other than rebound and play defense at times. If TJD can be allowed to stay in the floor and encourage to SHOOT the ball he may be a game changer. But if keeping the likes of him and others in a confined box, never going to develop these players, evolving to their full potential. Kerr just want guys good enough to complement an aging core. Not to take the reigns one day\ud83d\ude22",

This will be a stain on Kerr's career, the way that he has basically rejected a talented player! I've never seen this with a talented player whom has no off the court issues.

And no team other than the warriors is paying 27M to a declining Draymond who crashes out, cusses out refs and coaches, etc. Its a negative value contract. We are stuck with him for this season and the next. Unless you want to do a buyout... painful either way.",

You are replacing one disgruntled player who is passed his prime yet still wants to be seen as an all star due to his history for a return of another?  No way.  I rather we tank and get one of the top 4 first round draft picks this year.  Maybe the rookie can help Steph otherwise no one is beating OKC like you said in your previous videos!

Yes he's competitive and plays with heart  and understands the game. Also at times he gives them a triple or double double. I will even agree with those fans that believe he's the heart of that team. But that said someone needs to tell Draymond that he's not that impressive and he is just a better version of the guy that Memphis  traded Brooks I believe that's his last name.",

All the players that were mentioned as players that the Warriors should've traded JK for in the past, have not improved the teams they're on or went to in trades. Blame Dunleyvey for bad signings for why the Warriors are struggling. Sign injury prone players and seem surprised injuries play a role in inconsistent lineup cohesiveness. If this was Al's best game, there's part of the problem",

I could tell that he wasn't just acting nice for the fans but was genuinely very nice. There's some famous people that I've met that were not nice but for an NBA Player who is infamous techs, ejections, and trash talking Draymond Green is actually a really great personality.

As a Warriors fan, it's so frustrating when Draymond gets those techs, but I have to say, he's gotten better than he was the last couple of years. He just has to realize that other players are trying to get him ejected because he's so smart on the court. Don't fall for it! And please can you tell Mike we need a BIG! Adams, Valenciunas, a brawler! And some confident shooters that go for it when Steph is not available.",

They're already one foot into rebuild, Dame hasn't been happy in a while and they don't know what kind of chances they may have in trading him further down the line. They need to get active before the deadline here, also Washington are a weird team where they don't really have a path going forward but they also aren't adjusting, I wonder how Brad Beal is feeling about all of that. I hope we get to see some big deals to spice things up",

    "text": "Revisionist history is crazy. Draymond Vetoed the trade 2 years ago. At the time Lauri averaged 23-8-6. It would have cost them kuminga who in his third season was averaging 16-5-2, moody who was a lottery pick in his second season, podz another young player, and 6-8 first round picks (unprotected and swaps). Every single GM said the Jazz has no real intention of trading markkanen with the asking price for him at the time. This was also before the Jimmy trade. So in the warriors eyes they were able to trade for a guy averaging 17-5-5 who\u2019s a much better defender than Lauri while still keeping half the picks they would\u2019ve traded away AND they were able to hold on to their two young lottery picks. The young players aren\u2019t working out quite as well as the warriors would hope and butler is old now but it\u2019s not a guarantee that curry, dray, markkanen and a bunch of minimum guys would be better than the current warriors roster anyways that still has assets to grab another player",

Giving up your entire future for a dude whose NEVER played a playoff game, and looks amazing because the entire offense is built around him by a brilliant coach in Will Hardy does not mean anything about how you will perform when he's your 3rd offensive guy. Don't bury the future because you think you might, maybe, if youre lucky, be able to steak past OKC. You gotta be realistic on what happens if you don't win a title?
